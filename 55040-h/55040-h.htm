<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>ADDRESSED TO ANY MOTHER.</i>)</p>

<p class="p2 noindent"><span class="smcap">I have</span> reason to
believe that &#8220;Alice&#8217;s Adventures in Wonderland&#8221;
has been read by some hundreds of English Children, aged from Five
to Fifteen: also by Children, aged from Fifteen to Twenty-five: yet
again by Children, aged from Twenty-five to Thirty-five: and even by
Children&mdash;for there <em>are</em> such&mdash;Children in whom no waning of
health and strength, no weariness of the solemn mockery, and the gaudy
glitter, and the hopeless misery, of Life has availed to parch the pure
fountain of joy that wells up in all child-like hearts&mdash;Children
of a &#8220;certain&#8221; age, whose tale of years must be left
untold, and buried in respectful silence.</p>

<p>And my ambition <em>now</em> is (is it a vain one?) to be read by Children
aged from Nought to Five. To be read? Nay, not so! Say rather to be
thumbed, to be cooed over, to be dogs&#8217;-eared, to be rumpled, to
be kissed, by the illiterate, ungrammatical, dimpled Darlings, that
fill your Nursery with merry uproar, and your inmost heart of hearts
with a restful gladness!</p>

<p>Such, for instance, as a child I once knew, who&mdash;having been
carefully instructed that <em>one</em> of any earthly thing was enough for
any little girl; and that to ask for <em>two</em> buns, <em>two</em> oranges, <em>two</em>
of anything, would certainly bring upon her the awful charge of being
&#8220;greedy&#8221;&mdash;was found one morning sitting up in bed,
solemnly regarding her <em>two</em> little naked feet, and murmuring to
herself, softly and penitently, &#8220;deedy!&#8221;</p>

<h2>I.<br />

THE WHITE RABBIT.</h2>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Once</span> upon a time, there
was a little girl called Alice: and she had a very curious dream.</p>

<p>Would you like to hear what it was that she dreamed about?</p>

<p>Well, this was the <em>first</em> thing that happened. A White Rabbit came
running by, in a great hurry; and, just as it passed Alice, it stopped,
and took its watch out of its pocket.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>Wasn&#8217;t <em>that</em> a funny thing? Did <em>you</em> ever see a Rabbit that
had a watch, and a pocket to put it in? Of course, when a Rabbit has a
watch, it <em>must</em> have a pocket to put it in: it would never do to carry
it about in its mouth&mdash;&mdash;and it wants its hands sometimes, to
run about with.</p>

<p>Hasn&#8217;t it got pretty pink eyes (I think <em>all</em> White Rabbits
have pink eyes); and pink ears; and a nice brown coat; and you can just
see its red pocket-handkerchief peeping out of its coat-pocket: and,
what with its blue neck-tie and its yellow waistcoat, it really is
<em>very</em> nicely dressed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh dear, oh dear!&#8221; said the Rabbit. &#8220;I shall be
too late!&#8221; <em>What</em> would it be too late <em>for</em>, I wonder? Well, you
see, it had to go and visit the Duchess (you&#8217;ll see a picture
of the Duchess, soon, sitting in her kitchen): and the Duchess was a
very cross old lady: and the Rabbit <em>knew</em> she&#8217;d be very angry
indeed if he kept her waiting. So the poor thing was as frightened as
frightened could be (Don&#8217;t you see how he&#8217;s trembling?
Just shake the book a little,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3"
id="Page_3">[3]</a></span> from side to side, and you&#8217;ll soon see
him tremble), because he thought the Duchess would have his head cut
off, for a punishment. That was what the Queen of Hearts used to do,
when <em>she</em> was angry with people (you&#8217;ll see a picture of <em>her</em>,
soon): at least she used to <em>order</em> their heads to be cut off, and she
always <em>thought</em> it was done, though they never <em>really</em> did it.</p>

<p>And so, when the White Rabbit ran away, Alice wanted to see what
would happen to it: so she ran after it: and she ran, and she ran, till
she tumbled right down the rabbit-hole.</p>

<p>And then she had a very long fall indeed. Down, and down, and down,
till she began to wonder if she was going right <em>through</em> the World, so
as to come out on the other side!</p>

<p>It was just like a very deep well: only there was no water in it.
If anybody <em>really</em> had such a fall as that, it would kill them, most
likely: but you know it doesn&#8217;t hurt a bit to fall in a <em>dream</em>,
because, all the time you <em>think</em> you&#8217;re falling, you really
<em>are</em> lying somewhere, safe and sound, and fast asleep!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>However, this terrible fall came to an end at last, and down came
Alice on a heap of sticks and dry leaves. But she wasn&#8217;t a bit
hurt, and up she jumped, and ran after the Rabbit again.</p>

<p>And so that was the beginning of Alice&#8217;s curious dream. And,
next time you see a White Rabbit, try and fancy <em>you&#8217;re</em> going to
have a curious dream, just like dear little Alice.</p>

<h2>II.<br />

HOW ALICE GREW TALL.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">And</span> so, after Alice had tumbled down the
rabbit-hole, and had run a long long way underground, all of a sudden
she found herself in a great hall, with doors all round it.</p>

<p>But all the doors were locked: so, you see, poor Alice
couldn&#8217;t get out of the hall: and that made her very sad.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>However, after a little while, she came to a little table, all made
of glass, with three legs (There are <em>two</em> of the legs in the picture,
and just the <em>beginning</em> of the other leg, do you see?), and on the
table was a little key: and she went round the hall, and tried if she
could unlock any of the doors with it.</p>

<p>Poor Alice! The key wouldn&#8217;t unlock <em>any</em> of the doors. But at
last she came upon a tiny little door: and oh, how glad she was, when
she found the key would fit it!</p>

<p>So she unlocked the tiny little door, and she stooped down and
looked through it, and what do you think she saw? Oh, such a beautiful
garden! And she did so <em>long</em> to go into it! But the door was <em>far</em> too
small. She couldn&#8217;t squeeze herself through, any more than <em>you</em>
could squeeze yourself into a mouse-hole!</p>

<p>So poor little Alice locked up the door, and took the key back to
the table again: and <em>this</em> time she found quite a new thing on it
(now look at the picture again), and what do you think it was? It was
a little bottle, with a label<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7"
id="Page_7">[7]</a></span> tied to it, with the words &#8220;DRINK
ME&#8221; on the label.</p>

<p>So she tasted it: and it was <em>very</em> nice: so she set to work,
and drank it up. And then <em>such</em> a curious thing happened to her!
You&#8217;ll never guess what it was: so I shall have to tell you.
She got smaller, and smaller, till at last she was just the size of a
little doll!</p>

<p>Then she said to herself &#8220;<em>Now</em> I&#8217;m the right size to
get through the little door!&#8221; And away she ran. But, when she got
there, the door was locked, and the key was on the top of the table,
and she couldn&#8217;t reach it! <em>Wasn&#8217;t</em> it a pity she had
locked up the door again?</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 162px;">
  <a href="images/i_020.jpg">
    <img src="images/i_020tn.jpg" width="162" height="400" alt="very tall Alice with very long neck" />
  </a>
</div>

<p>Well, the next thing she found was a little cake: and it had the
words &#8220;EAT ME&#8221; marked on it. So of course she set to work
and ate it up. And <em>then</em> what do you think happened to her? No,
you&#8217;ll never guess! I shall have to tell you again.</p>

<p>She grew, and she grew, and she grew. Taller than she was before!
Taller than <em>any</em> child! Taller than any grown-up person! Taller,<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span> and taller,
and taller! Just look at the picture, and you&#8217;ll <em>see</em> how tall
she got!</p>

<p>Which would <em>you</em> have liked the best, do you think, to be a little
tiny Alice, no larger than a kitten, or a great tall Alice, with your
head always knocking against the ceiling?</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<h2>III.<br />

THE POOL OF TEARS.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Perhaps</span> you think Alice must have been
very much pleased, when she had eaten the little cake, to find herself
growing so tremendously tall? Because of course it would be easy
enough, <em>now</em>, to reach the little key off the glass table, and to open
the little tiny door.</p>

<p>Well, of course she could do <em>that</em>: but what good was it to get the
door open, when she couldn&#8217;t get <em>through</em>? She was worse off
than ever, poor thing! She could just manage, by putting her head down,
close to the ground, to <em>look</em> through with one eye! But that was <em>all</em>
she could do. No wonder the poor tall child sat down and cried as if
her heart would break.</p>

<p>So she cried, and she cried. And her tears ran down the middle
of the hall, like a deep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10"
id="Page_10">[10]</a></span> river. And very soon there was quite a
large Pool of Tears, reaching half-way down the hall.</p>

<p>And there she might have staid, till this very day, if the White
Rabbit hadn&#8217;t happened to come through the hall, on his way to
visit the Duchess. He was dressed up as grand as grand could be, and
he had a pair of white kid gloves in one hand, and a little fan in the
other hand: and he kept on muttering to himself &#8220;Oh, the Duchess,
the Duchess! Oh, <em>won&#8217;t</em> she be savage if I&#8217;ve kept her
waiting!&#8221;</p>

<p>But he didn&#8217;t see Alice, you know. So, when she began to say
&#8220;If you please, Sir&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; her voice seemed to come
from the top of the hall, because her head was so high up. And the
Rabbit was dreadfully frightened: and he dropped the gloves and the
fan, and ran away as hard as he could go.</p>

<p>Then a <em>very</em> curious thing indeed happened. Alice took up the fan,
and began to fan herself with it: and, lo and behold, she got quite
small again, and, all in a minute, she was just about the size of a
mouse!</p>

<p>Now look at the picture, and you&#8217;ll soon guess what happened
next. It looks just like the sea, doesn&#8217;t it? But it <em>really</em> is
the Pool of Tears&mdash;&mdash;all made of <em>Alice&#8217;s</em> tears, you
know!</p>

<p>And Alice has tumbled into the Pool: and the Mouse has tumbled in:
and there they are, swimming about together.</p>

<p>Doesn&#8217;t Alice look pretty, as she swims across the picture?
You can just see her blue stockings, far away under the water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12"
id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>But why is the Mouse swimming away from Alice in such a hurry? Well,
the reason is, that Alice began talking about cats and dogs: and a
Mouse always <em>hates</em> talking about cats and dogs!</p>

<p>Suppose <em>you</em> were swimming about, in a Pool of your own Tears: and
suppose somebody began talking to <em>you</em> about lesson-books and bottles
of medicine, wouldn&#8217;t <em>you</em> swim away as hard as you could
go?</p>

<h2>IV.<br />

THE CAUCUS-RACE.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Alice and the Mouse had got out of
the Pool of Tears, of course they were very wet: and so were a lot of
other curious creatures, that had tumbled in as well. There was a Dodo
(that&#8217;s the great bird, in front, leaning on a walking-stick);
and a Duck; and a Lory (that&#8217;s just behind the Duck, looking over
its head); and an Eaglet (that&#8217;s on the left-hand side of the
Lory); and several others.</p>

<p>Well, and so they didn&#8217;t know how in the world they were
to get dry again. But the Dodo&mdash;&mdash;who was a very wise
bird&mdash;&mdash;told them the right way was to have a Caucus-Race.
And what do you think <em>that</em> was?</p>

<p><em>You don&#8217;t know?</em> Well, you <em>are</em> an ignorant child! Now, be
very attentive, and I&#8217;ll soon cure you of your ignorance!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14"
id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>First, you must have a <em>racecourse</em>. It ought to be a <em>sort</em> of
circle, but it doesn&#8217;t much matter <em>what</em> shape it is, so long as
it goes a good way round, and joins on to itself again.</p>

<p>Then, you must put all the <em>racers</em> on the course, here and there:
it doesn&#8217;t matter <em>where</em>, so long as you don&#8217;t crowd them
too much together.</p>

<p>Then, you needn&#8217;t say &#8220;One, two, three, and away!&#8221;
but let them all set off running just when they like, and leave off
just when they like.</p>

<p>So all these creatures, Alice and all, went on running round and
round, till they were all quite dry again. And then the Dodo said
<em>everybody</em> had won, and <em>everybody</em> must have prizes!</p>

<p>Of course <em>Alice</em> had to give them their prizes. And she had nothing
to give them but a few comfits she happened to have in her pocket.
And there was just one a-piece, all round. And there was no prize for
Alice!</p>

<p>So what do you think they did? Alice had nothing left but
her thimble. Now look at the picture, and you&#8217;ll see what
happened.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

  </a>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Hand it over here!&#8221; said the Dodo.</p>

<p>Then the Dodo took the thimble and handed it back to Alice, and said
&#8220;We beg your acceptance of this elegant thimble!&#8221; And then
all the other creatures cheered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16"
id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>Wasn&#8217;t <em>that</em> a curious sort of present to give her? Suppose
they wanted to give <em>you</em> a birthday-present, would you rather they
should go to your toy-cupboard, and pick out your nicest doll, and
say &#8220;Here, my love, here&#8217;s a lovely birthday-present
for you!&#8221; or would you like them to give you something <em>new</em>,
something that <em>didn&#8217;t</em> belong to you before?</p>

<h2>V.<br />

BILL, THE LIZARD.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Now</span> I&#8217;m going to tell you about
Alice&#8217;s Adventures in the White Rabbit&#8217;s house.</p>

<p>Do you remember how the Rabbit dropped his gloves and his fan, when
he was so frightened at hearing Alice&#8217;s voice, that seemed to
come down from the sky? Well, of course he couldn&#8217;t go to visit
the Duchess <em>without</em> his gloves and his fan: so, after a bit, he came
back again to look for them.</p>

<p>By this time the Dodo and all the other curious creatures had gone
away, and Alice was wandering about all alone.</p>

<p>So what do you think he did? Actually he thought she was his
housemaid, and began<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18"
id="Page_18">[18]</a></span> ordering her about! &#8220;Mary
Ann!&#8221; he said. &#8220;Go home this very minute, and fetch me a
pair of gloves and a fan! Quick, now!&#8221;</p>

<p>Perhaps he couldn&#8217;t see very clearly with his pink eyes:
for I&#8217;m sure Alice doesn&#8217;t look very <em>like</em> a housemaid,
<em>does</em> she? However she was a very good-natured little girl: so she
wasn&#8217;t a bit offended, but ran off to the Rabbit&#8217;s house as
quick as she could.</p>

<p>It was lucky she found the door open: for, if she had had to ring, I
suppose the <em>real</em> Mary Ann would have come to open the door: and she
would <em>never</em> have let Alice come in. And I&#8217;m sure it was <em>very</em>
lucky she didn&#8217;t meet the real Mary Ann, as she trotted upstairs:
for I&#8217;m afraid she would have taken Alice for a robber!</p>

<p>So at last she found her way into the Rabbit&#8217;s room: and there
was a pair of gloves lying on the table, and she was just going to take
them up and go away, when she happened to see a little bottle on the
table. And of course it had the words &#8220;DRINK ME!&#8221; on the
label. And of course Alice drank some!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19"
id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>Well, I think that was <em>rather</em> lucky, too: don&#8217;t <em>you</em>? For,
if she <em>hadn&#8217;t</em> drunk any, all this wonderful adventure, that
I&#8217;m going to tell you about, wouldn&#8217;t have happened at all.
And wouldn&#8217;t <em>that</em> have been a pity?</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 150px;">

    <img src="images/i_031tn.jpg" width="150" height="400" alt="Bill the Lizard flying out of a chimney" />
  </a>
</div>

<p>You&#8217;re getting so used to Alice&#8217;s Adventures, that
I daresay you can guess what happened next? If you can&#8217;t,
I&#8217;ll tell you.</p>

<p>She grew, and she grew, and she grew. And in a very short time the
room was full of <em>Alice</em>: just in the same way as a jar is full of jam!
There was <em>Alice</em> all the way up to the ceiling: and <em>Alice</em> in every
corner of the room!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20"
id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>The door opened inwards: so of course there wasn&#8217;t any room to
open it: so when the Rabbit got tired of waiting, and came to fetch his
gloves for himself, of course he couldn&#8217;t get in.</p>

<p>So what do you think he did? (Now we come to the picture). He sent
Bill, the Lizard, up to the roof of the house, and told him to get
down the chimney. But Alice happened to have one of her feet in the
fire-place: so, when she heard Bill coming down the chimney, she just
gave a little tiny kick, and away went Bill, flying up into the sky!</p>

<p>Poor little Bill! Don&#8217;t you pity him very much? How frightened
he must have been!</p>

<h2>VI.<br />

THE DEAR LITTLE PUPPY.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Well</span>, it doesn&#8217;t look such a very
<em>little</em> Puppy, does it? But then, you see, Alice had grown very small
indeed: and <em>that&#8217;s</em> what makes the Puppy look so large. When
Alice had eaten one of those little magic cakes, that she found in the
White Rabbit&#8217;s house, it made her get quite small, directly, so
that she could get through the door: or else she could <em>never</em> have got
out of the house again. Wouldn&#8217;t <em>that</em> have been a pity? Because
then she wouldn&#8217;t have dreamed all the other curious things that
we&#8217;re going to read about.</p>

<p>So it really <em>was</em> a <em>little</em> Puppy, you see. And isn&#8217;t
it a little <em>pet</em>? And look at the way<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span> it&#8217;s barking at the
little stick that Alice is holding out for it! You can see she was a
<em>little</em> afraid of it, all the time, because she&#8217;s got behind
that great thistle, for fear it should run over her. That would have
been just about as bad, for <em>her</em>, as it would be for <em>you</em> to be run
over by a waggon and four horses!</p>

<p>Have you got a little pet puppy at <em>your</em> home? If you have, I hope
you&#8217;re always kind to it, and give it nice things to eat.</p>

<p>Once upon a time, I knew some little children, about as big as you;
and they had a little pet dog of their own; and it was called <em>Dash</em>.
And this is what they told me about its birthday-treat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know, one day we remembered it was Dash&#8217;s
birthday that day. So we said &#8216;Let&#8217;s give Dash a nice
birthday-treat, like what we have on <em>our</em> birthdays!&#8217; So we
thought and we thought &#8216;Now, what is it <em>we</em> like best of all,
on <em>our</em> birthdays?&#8217; And we thought and we thought. And at
last we all called out together &#8220;Why, its <em>oatmeal-porridge</em>,
of course!&#8221; So of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23"
id="Page_23">[23]</a></span> course we thought Dash would be <em>quite</em>
sure to like it very much, too.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 308px;">
  <a href="images/i_035.jpg">
    <img src="images/i_035tn.jpg" width="308" height="375" alt="a puppy and Alice when she was just small" />
  </a>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24"
id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;So we went to the cook, and we got her to make a saucerful
of nice oatmeal-porridge. And then we called Dash into the house,
and we said &#8216;Now, Dash, you&#8217;re going to have your
birthday-treat!&#8217; We expected Dash would jump for joy: but it
didn&#8217;t, one bit!</p>

<p>&#8220;So we put the saucer down before it, and we said &#8216;Now,
Dash, don&#8217;t be greedy! Eat it nicely, like a good dog!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;So Dash just tasted it with the tip of its tongue: and then
it made, oh, such a horrid face! And then, do you know, it did <em>hate</em>
it so, it wouldn&#8217;t eat a bit more of it! So we had to put it all
down its throat with a spoon!&#8221;</p>

<p>I wonder if Alice will give <em>this</em> little Puppy some porridge? I
don&#8217;t think she <em>can</em>, because she hasn&#8217;t got any with her.
I can&#8217;t see any saucer in the picture.</p>

<h2>VII.<br />

THE BLUE CATERPILLAR.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Would</span> you like to know what happened to
Alice, after she had got away from the Puppy? It was far too large
an animal, you know, for <em>her</em> to play with. (I don&#8217;t suppose
<em>you</em> would much enjoy playing with a young Hippopotamus, would you?
You would always be expecting to be crushed as flat as a pancake under
its great heavy feet!) So Alice was very glad to run away, while it
wasn&#8217;t looking.</p>

<p>Well, she wandered up and down, and didn&#8217;t know what in the
world to do, to make herself grow up to her right size again. Of course
she knew that she had to eat or drink <em>something</em>: that was the regular
rule, you know: but she couldn&#8217;t guess <em>what</em> thing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26"
id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 259px;">
  <a href="images/i_038.jpg">
    <img src="images/i_038tn.jpg" width="259" height="350" alt="Alice looking at the blue caterpillar sitting on a mushroom" />
  </a>
</div>

<p>However, she soon came to a great mushroom, that was so tall that
she couldn&#8217;t see over the top of it without standing on tip-toe.
And what do you think she saw? Something that I&#8217;m sure <em>you</em>
never talked to, in all your life!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27"
id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>It was a large Blue Caterpillar.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll tell you, soon, what Alice and the Caterpillar talked
about: but first let us have a good look at the picture.</p>

<p>That curious thing, standing in front of the Caterpillar, is
called a &#8220;hookah&#8221;: and it&#8217;s used for smoking. The
smoke comes through that long tube, that winds round and round like a
serpent.</p>

<p>And do you see its long nose and chin? At least, they <em>look</em> exactly
like a nose and chin, don&#8217;t they? But they really <em>are</em> two of
its legs. You know a Caterpillar has got <em>quantities</em> of legs: you can
see some more of them, further down.</p>

<p>What a bother it must be to a Caterpillar, counting over such a lot
of legs, every night, to make sure it hasn&#8217;t lost any of them!</p>

<p>And <em>another</em> great bother must be, having to settle <em>which</em> leg
it had better move first. I think, if <em>you</em> had forty or fifty legs,
and if you wanted to go a walk, you&#8217;d be such a time in settling
which leg to begin with, that you&#8217;d never go a walk at all!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28"
id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>And what did Alice and the Caterpillar <em>talk</em> about, I wonder?</p>

<p>Well, Alice told it how <em>very</em> confusing it was, being first one
size and then another.</p>

<p>And the Caterpillar asked her if she liked the size she was, just
then.</p>

<p>And Alice said she would like to be just a <em>little</em> bit
larger&mdash;&mdash;three inches was such a <em>wretched</em> height to be!
(Just mark off three inches on the wall, about the length of your
middle finger, and you&#8217;ll see what size she was.)</p>

<p>And the Caterpillar told her one side of the mushroom would make her
grow <em>taller</em>, and the other side would make her grow <em>shorter</em>.</p>

<p>So Alice took two little bits of it with her to nibble, and managed
to make herself quite a nice comfortable height, before she went on to
visit the Duchess.</p>

<h2>VIII.<br />

THE PIG-BABY.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Would</span> you like to hear about
Alice&#8217;s visit to the Duchess? It was a very interesting visit
indeed, I can assure you.</p>

<p>Of course she knocked at the door to begin with: but nobody came: so
she had to open it for herself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30"
id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>Now, if you look at the picture, you&#8217;ll see exactly what Alice
saw when she got inside.</p>

<p>The door led right into the kitchen, you see. The Duchess sat in the
middle of the room, nursing the Baby. The Baby was howling. The soup
was boiling. The Cook was stirring the soup. The Cat&mdash;&mdash;it
was a <em>Cheshire</em> Cat&mdash;&mdash;was grinning, as Cheshire Cats always
do. All these things were happening just as Alice went in.</p>

<p>The Duchess has a beautiful cap and gown, hasn&#8217;t she? But
I&#8217;m afraid she <em>hasn&#8217;t</em> got a very beautiful <em>face</em>.</p>

<p>The Baby&mdash;&mdash;well, I daresay you&#8217;ve seen <em>several</em>
nicer babies than <em>that</em>: and more good-tempered ones, too. However,
take a good look at it, and we&#8217;ll see if you know it again, next
time you meet it!</p>

<p>The Cook&mdash;&mdash;well, you <em>may</em> have seen nicer cooks, once or
twice.</p>

<p>But I&#8217;m nearly sure you&#8217;ve <em>never</em> seen a nicer <em>Cat</em>!
Now <em>have</em> you? And <em>wouldn&#8217;t</em> you like to have a Cat of your
own, just like that one, with lovely green eyes, and smiling so
sweetly?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31"
id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>The Duchess was very rude to Alice. And no wonder. Why, she even
called her own <em>Baby</em> &#8220;Pig!&#8221; And it <em>wasn&#8217;t</em> a Pig,
<em>was</em> it? And she ordered the Cook to chop off Alice&#8217;s head:
though of course the Cook didn&#8217;t do it: and at last she threw the
Baby at her! So Alice caught the Baby, and took it away with her: and I
think that was about the best thing she could do.</p>

<p>So she wandered away, through the wood, carrying the ugly little
thing with her. And a great job it was to keep hold of it, it wriggled
about so. But at last she found out that the <em>proper</em> way was, to keep
tight hold of its left foot and its right ear.</p>

<p>But don&#8217;t <em>you</em> try to hold on to a Baby like that, my Child!
There are not many babies that <em>like</em> being nursed in <em>that</em> way!</p>

<p>Well, and so the Baby kept grunting, and grunting so that Alice had
to say to it, quite seriously, &#8220;If you&#8217;re going to turn
into a <em>Pig</em>, my dear, I&#8217;ll have nothing more to do with you.
Mind now!&#8221;</p>

    <img src="images/i_044tn.jpg" width="201" height="300" alt="Alice holding the pig" />
  </a>
</div>

<p>And at last she looked down into its face, and what <em>do</em> you think
had happened to it? Look at the picture, and see if you can guess.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, <em>that&#8217;s</em> not the Baby that Alice was nursing, is
it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Ah, I <em>knew</em> you wouldn&#8217;t know it again, though I told you to
take a good look at it! Yes, it <em>is</em> the Baby. And it&#8217;s turned
into a little <em>Pig</em>!</p>

<p>So Alice put it down, and let it trot away into the wood. And she
said to herself &#8220;It was a <em>very</em> ugly <em>Baby</em>: but it makes rather
a handsome <em>Pig</em>, I think.&#8221;</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t you think she was right?</p>

<h2>IX.<br />

THE CHESHIRE-CAT.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">All</span> alone, all alone! Poor Alice! No
Baby, not even a <em>Pig</em> to keep her company!</p>

<p>So you may be sure she was very glad indeed, when she saw the
Cheshire-Cat, perched up in a tree, over her head.</p>

<p>The Cat has a very nice smile, no doubt: but just look what a lot of
teeth it&#8217;s got! Isn&#8217;t Alice just a <em>little</em> shy of it?</p>

<p>Well, yes, a <em>little</em>. But then, it couldn&#8217;t help having
teeth, you know: and it <em>could</em> have helped smiling, supposing it had
been cross. So, on the whole, she was <em>glad</em>.</p>

<p>Doesn&#8217;t Alice look very prim, holding her head so straight up,
and with her hands behind her, just as if she were going to say her
lessons to the Cat!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34"
id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 277px;">
  <a href="images/i_046.jpg">
    <img src="images/i_046tn.jpg" width="277" height="400" alt="Cheshire cat in a tree, looking down at Alice" />
  </a>
</div>

<p>And that reminds me. There&#8217;s a little lesson I want to teach
<em>you</em>, while we&#8217;re looking at this picture of Alice and the Cat.
Now don&#8217;t be in a bad temper about it, my dear Child! It&#8217;s
a very <em>little</em> lesson indeed!</p>

<p>Do you see that Fox-Glove growing close to the tree? And do
you know why it&#8217;s called a <em>Fox</em>-Glove? Perhaps you<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span> think
it&#8217;s got something to do with a Fox? No indeed! <em>Foxes</em> never
wear Gloves!</p>

<p>The right word is &#8220;<em>Folk&#8217;s</em>-Gloves.&#8221; Did you ever
hear that Fairies used to be called &#8220;the good <em>Folk</em>&#8221;?</p>

<p>Now we&#8217;ve finished the lesson, and we&#8217;ll wait a minute,
till you&#8217;ve got your temper again.</p>

<p>Well? Do you feel quite good-natured again? No temper-ache? No
crossness about the corners of the mouth? Then we&#8217;ll go on.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cheshire Puss!&#8221; said Alice. (<em>Wasn&#8217;t</em> that a
pretty name for a Cat?) &#8220;Would you tell me which way I ought to
go from here?&#8221;</p>

<p>And so the Cheshire-Cat told her which way she ought to go, if she
wanted to visit the Hatter, and which way to go, to visit the March
Hare. &#8220;They&#8217;re both mad!&#8221; said the Cat.</p>

<p>And then the Cat vanished away, just like the flame of a candle when
it goes out!</p>

<p>So Alice set off, to visit the March Hare. And as she went along,
there was the Cat again! And she told it she didn&#8217;t <em>like</em> it
coming and going so quickly.</p>

  </a>
</div>

<p>So this time the Cat vanished quite slowly, beginning with the tail,
and ending with the grin. Wasn&#8217;t <em>that</em> a curious thing, a Grin
without any Cat? Would you like to see one?</p>

<p>If you turn up the corner of this leaf, you&#8217;ll have Alice
looking at the Grin: and she doesn&#8217;t look a bit more frightened
than when she was looking at the Cat, <em>does</em> she?</p>

<h2>X.<br />

THE MAD TEA-PARTY.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> is the Mad Tea-Party. You see Alice
had left the Cheshire-Cat, and had gone off to see the March Hare and
the Hatter, as the Cheshire-Cat had advised her: and she found them
having tea under a great tree, with a Dormouse sitting between them.</p>

<p>There were only those three at the table, but there were quantities
of tea-cups set all along it. You ca&#8217;n&#8217;t see all the table,
you know, and even in the bit you <em>can</em> see there are nine cups,
counting the one the March Hare has got in his hand.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s the March Hare, with the long ears, and straws mixed
up with his hair. The straws<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38"
id="Page_38">[38]</a></span> showed he was mad&mdash;&mdash;I
don&#8217;t know why. Never twist up straws among <em>your</em> hair, for fear
people should think you&#8217;re mad!</p>

<p>There was a nice green arm-chair at the end of the table, that
looked as if it was just meant for Alice: so she went and sat down in
it.</p>

<p>Then she had quite a long talk with the March Hare and the Hatter.
The Dormouse didn&#8217;t say much. You see it was fast asleep
generally, and it only just woke up for a moment, now and then.</p>

<p>As long as it was asleep, it was very useful to the March Hare
and the Hatter, because it had a nice round soft head, just like a
pillow: so they could put their elbows on it, and lean across it, and
talk to each other quite comfortably. You wouldn&#8217;t like people
to use <em>your</em> head for a pillow, <em>would</em> you? But if you were fast
asleep, like the Dormouse, you wouldn&#8217;t feel it: so I suppose you
wouldn&#8217;t care about it.</p>

    <img src="images/i_051tn.jpg" width="401" height="300" alt="Alice, March Hare, and Mad Hatter at a table laid for tea" />
  </a>
</div>

<p>I&#8217;m afraid they gave Alice <em>very</em> little to eat and
drink. However, after a bit, she helped herself to some tea and
bread-and-butter: only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39"
id="Page_39">[39]</a></span> I don&#8217;t quite see where she <em>got</em>
the bread-and-butter: and she had no plate for it. Nobody seems to
have a plate except the Hatter. I believe the March Hare must have
had one as well: because, when they all moved one place on (that was
the rule at this curious tea-party), and Alice had to go into the
place of the March Hare, she found he had just upset the milk-jug
into his plate. So I suppose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40"
id="Page_40">[40]</a></span> his plate and the milk-jug are hidden
behind that large tea-pot.</p>

<p>The Hatter used to carry about hats to sell: and even the one that
he&#8217;s got on his head is meant to be sold. You see it&#8217;s
got its price marked on it&mdash;&mdash;a &#8220;10&#8221; and a
&#8220;6&#8221;&mdash;&mdash;that means &#8220;ten shillings and
sixpence.&#8221; Wasn&#8217;t that a funny way of selling hats? And
hasn&#8217;t he got a beautiful neck-tie on? Such a lovely yellow tie,
with large red spots.</p>

<p>He has just got up to say to Alice &#8220;Your hair wants
cutting!&#8221; That was a rude thing to say, <em>wasn&#8217;t</em> it? And
do you think her hair <em>does</em> want cutting? <em>I</em> think it&#8217;s a very
pretty length&mdash;&mdash;just the right length.</p>

<h2>XI.<br />

THE QUEEN&#8217;S GARDEN.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> is a little bit of the beautiful
garden I told you about. You see Alice had managed at last to get
quite small, so that she could go through the little door. I suppose
she was about as tall as a mouse, if it stood on its hind-legs: so of
course this was a <em>very</em> tiny rose-tree: and these are <em>very</em> tiny
gardeners.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 218px;">
  <a href="images/i_054.jpg">
    <img src="images/i_054tn.jpg" width="218" height="300" alt="Three playing-card men standing by a rose bush" />
  </a>
</div>

<p>What funny little men they are! But <em>are</em> they men, do you think? I
think they must be live cards, with just a head, and arms, and legs,
so as to <em>look</em> like little men. And what <em>are</em> they doing with that
red paint, I wonder? Well, you see, this is what they told Alice<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span> The
Queen of Hearts wanted to have a <em>red</em> rose-tree just in that corner:
and these poor little gardeners had made a great mistake, and had put
in a <em>white</em> one instead: and they were so frightened about it, because
the Queen was <em>sure</em> to be angry, and then she would order all their
heads to be cut off!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43"
id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>She was a dreadfully savage Queen, and that was the way she
always did, when she was angry with people. &#8220;Off with their
heads!&#8221; They didn&#8217;t <em>really</em> cut their heads off, you know:
because nobody ever obeyed her: but that was what she always <em>said</em>.</p>

<p><em>Now</em> ca&#8217;n&#8217;t you guess what the poor little gardeners
are trying to do? They&#8217;re trying to paint the roses <em>red</em>, and
they&#8217;re in a great hurry to get it done before the Queen comes.
And then <em>perhaps</em> the Queen won&#8217;t find out it was a <em>white</em>
rose-tree to begin with: and then <em>perhaps</em> the little men won&#8217;t
get their heads cut off!</p>

<p>You see there were <em>five</em> large white roses on the
tree&mdash;&mdash;such a job to get them all painted red! But
they&#8217;ve got three and a half done, now, and if only they
wouldn&#8217;t stop to talk&mdash;&mdash;work away, little men, <em>do</em>
work away! Or the Queen will be coming before it&#8217;s done! And if
she finds any <em>white</em> roses on the tree, do you know what will happen?
It will be &#8220;Off with their heads!&#8221; Oh, work away, my little
men! Hurry, hurry!</p>

<h2>XII.<br />

THE LOBSTER-QUADRILLE.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Did</span> you ever play at Croquet? There are
large wooden balls, painted with different colours, that you have to
roll about; and arches of wire, that you have to send them through;
and great wooden mallets, with long handles, to knock the balls about
with.</p>

<p>Now look at the picture, and you&#8217;ll see that <em>Alice</em> has just
been playing a Game of Croquet.</p>

<p>&#8220;But she <em>couldn&#8217;t</em> play, with that great red
what&#8217;s-its-name in her arms! Why, how could she hold the
mallet?&#8221;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 217px;">
  <a href="images/i_058.jpg">
    <img src="images/i_058tn.jpg" width="217" height="300" alt="Alice holding a flamingo and talking to the Duchess" />
  </a>
</div>

<p>Why, my dear Child, that great red what&#8217;s-its-name (its
<em>real</em> name is &#8220;<em>a Flamingo</em>&#8221;) <em>is</em> the mallet! In this
Croquet-Game, the balls were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46"
id="Page_46">[46]</a></span> live <em>Hedge-hogs</em>&mdash;&mdash;you know a
hedge-hog can roll itself up into a ball?&mdash;&mdash;and the mallets
were live <em>Flamingos</em>!</p>

<p>So Alice is just resting from the Game, for a minute, to have a chat
with that dear old thing, the Duchess: and of course she keeps her
mallet under her arm, so as not to lose it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47"
id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;But I don&#8217;t think she <em>was</em> a dear old thing, one
bit! To call her Baby a <em>Pig</em>, and to want to chop off Alice&#8217;s
head!&#8221;</p>

<p>Oh, that was only a joke, about chopping off Alice&#8217;s head: and
as to the Baby&mdash;&mdash;why, it <em>was</em> a Pig, you know! And just
look at her <em>smile</em>! Why, it&#8217;s wider than all Alice&#8217;s head:
and yet you can only see half of it!</p>

<p>Well, they&#8217;d only had a <em>very</em> little chat, when the Queen
came and took Alice away, to see the Gryphon and the Mock Turtle.</p>

<p><em>You don&#8217;t know what a Gryphon is?</em> Well! Do you know
<em>anything</em>? That&#8217;s the question. However, look at the picture.
That creature with a red head, and red claws, and green scales, is the
<em>Gryphon</em>. Now you know.</p>

<p>And the other&#8217;s the <em>Mock Turtle</em>. It&#8217;s got a
calf&#8217;s-head, because calf&#8217;s head is used to make <em>Mock
Turtle Soup</em>. Now you know.</p>

<p>&#8220;But what are they <em>doing</em>, going round and round Alice like
that?&#8221;</p>

<p>Why, I thought of <em>course</em> you&#8217;d know <em>that</em>! They&#8217;re
dancing <em>a Lobster-Quadrille</em>.</p>

</div>

<p>And next time <em>you</em> meet a Gryphon and a Mock Turtle, I daresay
they&#8217;ll dance it for <em>you</em>, if you ask them prettily. Only
don&#8217;t let them come <em>quite</em> close, or they&#8217;ll be treading
on your toes, as they did on poor Alice&#8217;s.</p>

WHO STOLE THE TARTS?</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Did</span> you ever hear how the Queen of Hearts
made some tarts? And can you tell me what became of them?</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, of <em>course</em> I can! Doesn&#8217;t the song tell all about
it?</p>

<div class="poetry">
  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
<p><i>The Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts:</i></p>
<p class="i4"><i>All on a summer day:</i></p>
<p><i>The Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts,</i></p>
<p class="i4"><i>And took them quite away!</i>&#8221;</p>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Well, yes, the <em>Song</em> says so. But it would never do to
punish the poor Knave, just because there was a <em>Song</em> about
him. They had to take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50"
id="Page_50">[50]</a></span> him prisoner, and put chains on his
wrists, and bring him before the King of Hearts, so that there might be
a regular trial.</p>

<p>Now, if you look at the big picture, at the beginning of this book,
you&#8217;ll see what a grand thing a trial is, when the Judge is a
King!</p>

<p>The King is very grand, <em>isn&#8217;t</em> he? But he doesn&#8217;t look
very <em>happy</em>. I think that big crown, on the top of his wig, must be
<em>very</em> heavy and uncomfortable. But he had to wear them <em>both</em>, you
see, so that people might know he was a Judge <em>and</em> a King.</p>

<p>And <em>doesn&#8217;t</em> the Queen look cross? She can see the dish of
tarts on the table, that she had taken such trouble to make. And she
can see the bad Knave (do you see the chains hanging from his wrists?)
that stole them away from her: so I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s any
wonder if she <em>does</em> feel a <em>little</em> cross.</p>

<p>The White Rabbit is standing near the King, reading out the Song,
to tell everybody what a bad Knave he is: and the Jury (you can
just see two of them, up in the Jury-box,<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span> the Frog and the Duck)
have to settle whether he&#8217;s &#8220;guilty&#8221; or &#8220;not
guilty.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now I&#8217;ll tell you about the accident that happened to
Alice.</p>

<p>You see, she was sitting close by the Jury-box: and she was
called as a witness. You know what a &#8220;witness&#8221; is? A
&#8220;witness&#8221; is a person who has seen the prisoner do whatever
he&#8217;s accused of, or at any rate knows <em>something</em> that&#8217;s
important in the trial.</p>

<p>But <em>Alice</em> hadn&#8217;t seen the Queen <em>make</em> the tarts: and
she hadn&#8217;t seen the Knave <em>take</em> the tarts: and, in fact, she
didn&#8217;t know anything about it: so why in the world they wanted
<em>her</em> to be a witness, I&#8217;m sure <em>I</em> ca&#8217;n&#8217;t tell
you!</p>

<p>Anyhow, they <em>did</em> want her. And the White Rabbit blew his big
trumpet, and shouted out &#8220;Alice!&#8221; And so Alice jumped up in
a great hurry. And then&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>And then what <em>do</em> you think happened? Why, her skirt caught against
the Jury-box, and tipped it over, and all the poor little Jurors came
tumbling out of it!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52"

    <img src="images/i_064tn.jpg" width="284" height="350" alt="Alice watching as the Jurors fall from the Jury-box" />
  </a>
</div>

<p>Let&#8217;s try if we can make out all the twelve. You know there
ought to be twelve to make up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53"
id="Page_53">[53]</a></span> a Jury. I see the Frog, and the Dormouse,
and the Rat and the Ferret, and the Hedgehog, and the Lizard, and
the Bantam-Cock, and the Mole, and the Duck, and the Squirrel, and a
screaming bird, with a long beak, just behind the Mole.</p>

<p>But that only makes eleven: we must find one more creature.</p>

<p>Oh, do you see a little white head, coming out behind the Mole, and
just under the Duck&#8217;s beak? That makes up the twelve.</p>

<p>Mr. Tenniel says the screaming bird is a <em>Storkling</em> (of course
you know what <em>that</em> is?) and the little white head is a <em>Mouseling</em>.
Isn&#8217;t it a little <em>darling</em>?</p>

<p>Alice picked them all up again, very carefully, and I hope they
weren&#8217;t <em>much</em> hurt!</p>

<h2>XIV.<br />

THE SHOWER OF CARDS.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Oh</span> dear, oh dear! What <em>is</em> it all about?
And what&#8217;s happening to Alice?</p>

<p>Well, I&#8217;ll tell you all about it, as well I can. The way the
trial ended was this. The King wanted the Jury to settle whether the
Knave of Hearts was <em>guilty</em> or <em>not guilty</em>&mdash;&mdash;that means
that they were to settle whether <em>he</em> had stolen the Tarts, or if
somebody else had taken them. But the wicked <em>Queen</em> wanted to have
his <em>punishment</em> settled, first of all. That wasn&#8217;t at all fair,
<em>was</em> it? Because, you know, supposing he never <em>took</em> the Tarts, then
of course he oughtn&#8217;t to be punished. Would <em>you</em> like to be
punished for something you hadn&#8217;t done?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55"
id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 290px;">

    <img src="images/i_067tn.jpg" width="290" height="400" alt="Alice shielding herself as cards fly over her head" />
  </a>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56"
id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>So Alice said &#8220;Stuff and nonsense!&#8221;</p>

<p>So the Queen said &#8220;Off with her head!&#8221; (Just what she
always said, when she was angry.)</p>

<p>So Alice said &#8220;Who cares for <em>you</em>? You&#8217;re nothing but a
pack of cards!&#8221;</p>

<p>So they were <em>all</em> very angry, and flew up into the air, and came
tumbling down again, all over Alice, just like a shower of rain.</p>

<p>And I think you&#8217;ll <em>never</em> guess what happened next. The next
thing was, Alice woke up out of her curious dream. And she found that
the cards were only some leaves off the tree, that the wind had blown
down upon her face.</p>

<p><em>Wouldn&#8217;t</em> it be a nice thing to have a curious dream, just
like Alice?</p>

<p>The best plan is this. First lie down under a tree, and wait till a
White Rabbit runs by, with a watch in his hand: then shut your eyes,
and pretend to be dear little Alice.</p>

<p>Good-bye, Alice dear, good-bye!</p>

<h2>AN EASTER GREETING<br />

<hr class="r65" />

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Child</span>,</p>

<p><i>Please to fancy, if you can, that you are reading a real letter,
from a real friend whom you have seen, and whose voice you can seem to
yourself to hear, wishing you, as I do now with all my heart, a happy
Easter.</i></p>

<p><i>Do you know that delicious dreamy feeling, when one first wakes
on a summer morning, with the twitter of birds in the air, and the
fresh breeze coming in at the open window&mdash;&mdash;when, lying
lazily with eyes half shut, one sees as in a dream green boughs waving,
or waters rippling in a golden light? It is a pleasure very near to
sadness, bringing tears to one&#8217;s eyes like a beautiful<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span> picture
or poem. And is not that a Mother&#8217;s gentle hand that undraws
your curtains, and a Mother&#8217;s sweet voice that summons you to
rise? To rise and forget, in the bright sunlight, the ugly dreams that
frightened you so when all was dark&mdash;&mdash;to rise and enjoy
another happy day, first kneeling to thank that unseen Friend who sends
you the beautiful sun?</i></p>

<p><i>Are these strange words from a writer of such tales as
&#8220;Alice&#8221;? And is this a strange letter to find in a book
of nonsense? It may be so. Some perhaps may blame me for thus mixing
together things grave and gay; others may smile and think it odd that
any one should speak of solemn things at all, except in Church and on a
Sunday: but I think&mdash;&mdash;nay, I am sure&mdash;&mdash;that some
children will read this gently and lovingly, and in the spirit in which
I have written it.</i></p>

<p><i>For I do not believe God means us thus to divide life into two
halves&mdash;&mdash;to wear a grave face on Sunday, and to think it
out-of-place to even so much as mention Him on a week-day. Do you
think He cares to see only kneeling figures and to hear only tones of
prayer&mdash;&mdash;and that He does not also love to see the lambs
leaping in the sunlight, and to hear the merry voices of the children,
as they roll among the hay? Surely their innocent laughter is as
sweet in His ears as the grandest anthem that ever rolled up from the
&#8220;dim religious light&#8221; of some solemn cathedral?</i></p>

<p><i>And if I have written anything to add to those stores of innocent
and healthy amusement that are laid up in books for the<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span> children
I love so well, it is surely something I may hope to look back upon
without shame and sorrow (as how much of life must then be recalled!)
when my turn comes to walk through the valley of shadows.</i></p>

<p><i>This Easter sun will rise on you, dear child, &#8220;feeling
your life in every limb,&#8221; and eager to rush out into the
fresh morning air&mdash;&mdash;and many an Easter-day will come and
go, before it finds you feeble and grey-headed, creeping wearily
out to bask once more in the sunlight&mdash;&mdash;but it is good,
even now, to think sometimes of that great morning when &#8220;the
Sun of righteousness&#8221; shall &#8220;arise with healing in his
wings.&#8221;</i></p>

<p><i>Surely your gladness need not be the less for the thought that
you will one day see a brighter dawn than this&mdash;&mdash;when
lovelier sights will meet your eyes than any waving trees or rippling
waters&mdash;&mdash;when angel-hands shall undraw your curtains, and
sweeter tones than ever loving Mother breathed shall wake you to a new
and glorious day&mdash;&mdash;and when all the sadness, and the sin,
that darkened life on this little earth, shall be forgotten like the
dreams of a night that is past!</i></p>

<p class="ph4">CAUTIONS TO READERS.</p>

<p>On August 1st, 1881, a story appeared in <cite>Aunt Judy&#8217;s Magazine</cite> No. 184,
entitled &#8220;The Land of Idleness, by <span class="smcap">Lewis Carroll</span>.&#8221; This story was really written
by a lady, <span class="smcap">Fr&auml;ulein Ida Lackowitz</span>. Acting on her behalf, Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span> forwarded
it to the Editor: and this led to the mistake of naming him as its author.</p>

<p>In October, 1887, the writer of an article on &#8220;Literature for the Little ones,&#8221; in
<cite>The Nineteenth Century</cite>, stated that, in 1864, &#8220;<span class="smcap">Tom Hood</span> was delighting the world
with such works as <cite>From Nowhere to the North Pole</cite>. Between <span class="smcap">Tom Hood</span> and Mr.
<span class="smcap">Lewis Carroll</span> there is more than a suspicion of resemblance in some particulars.
<cite>Alice&#8217;s Adventures in Wonderland</cite> narrowly escapes challenging a comparison with
<cite>From Nowhere to the North Pole</cite>. The idea of both is so similar that Mr. <span class="smcap">Carroll</span> can
hardly have been surprised if some people have believed he was inspired by <span class="smcap">Hood</span>.&#8221; The
date 1864 is a mistake. <cite>From Nowhere to the North Pole</cite> was first published in 1874.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and
official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
